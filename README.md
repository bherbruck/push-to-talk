# push-to-talk

Global, device-level push to talk, great for virtual meetings that are lacking this feature for some reason (like Microsoft Teams).

## ðŸ’¿ Installation

Download and run the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/bherbruck/push-to-talk/releases/) page.

After installation, the app will run at startup and automatically mute your microphone while running. Currently Windows is the only supported platform.

## ðŸ–± Usage

Only one key combination is currently supported. Press `Ctrl+Win` to unmute your primary microphone, it will be otherwise muted.

You may have to press the key combination when first joining a meeting to make it mute initially (I think Teams unmutes automatically when joining a meeting).

## âš  Warning

This will mute your microphone by default. If the application crashes, your microphone may remain muted and you will have to manually unmute it.
